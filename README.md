# KaggleTitanicProblem

This repository contains my aprroach of solving Titanic Problem on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview using different classification algorithms and I am uploading the jupyter notebook of all the algorithms that I used 

### The Machine Learning Algorithms used
1. K-Nearest neigbors
2. Suport vector machines
3. Logistic Regression
4. Random Forest
5. Decision Tree

The best result I got in terms of accuracy is by using SVM but the model still has scope of improvement in terms of Data pre-processing and feature engineering, so feel free to suggest changes

### The Results
All the results that I got from various algorithms are stored in their respective .csv files
